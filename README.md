# Getting Started with Create React App

this project is to get use to Reactjs and to start creating my portfolio  

# Description  of the project  
this project is a functional E-commerce store  

i have created this project using   
1-commerce js to provide the backend  
2-stripe to provide secure mony transaction  
3-React to create the front end  
4-sass to style the project  
  
--I haven't paid so much attention to the aesthetics of the website because I wanted to focus on learning React--


# how does the store work  
1- you can add the product you want to sell to your store through your commerce.js account and they will be mapped automatically to your store  
2- the money transaction is handled by stripe  
3- you have a filter search in the navigation  bar if you know what you are looking for  
4- add the products you want to buy to the cart  
5- from the cart you can checkout and perches the products  
6- iam using the testing api key in this deployment to test it the number of the testing visa card is 42 repeat it until you fill input box  





# through this project i have learned  
 practiced react ,react-router-dom , react-hook-form  
 to utilise APIs and to use a chain of APIs where each one depends on the previous API   
 to use commercejs and stripe
